# Virtual File System (VFS) in C

## Project Overview

This project simulates a **Virtual File System (VFS) in C language** that mimics basic UNIX-like file operations such as creating, reading, writing, truncating, and deleting files. It works entirely in memory using custom structures like inodes, file tables, and a user file descriptor table (UFDT).

## Role of the Virtual File System (VFS)

The Virtual File System (VFS) acts as an abstraction layer between user-level programs and various underlying file systems like ext4, FAT32, or NTFS. It provides a consistent set of file operations (such as open, read, write, and close), allowing the operating system to interact with different file systems in a uniform way. This design simplifies file handling, enhances modularity, and enables support for multiple file systems without changing core OS logic.

## Tech Stack

This Virtual File System (VFS) project is built using the following technologies and concepts:

| Technology / Concept      | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C Language**            | Core programming language used to implement all logic and memory handling   |
| **GCC Compiler**          | GNU Compiler Collection used to compile and build the project (`.c` files)  |
| **Data Structures**       | Custom structures like **Inode**, **SuperBlock**, **FileTable** and **UFDT** to simulate file system layers |
| **UNIX/Linux Concepts**   | Used as the foundational model to understand real-world VFS behavior         |
| **File System Simulation**| Mimics a real-world file system with support for operations like `read`, `write`, `ls`, etc. |

## How to Compile and Run

### Compilation (Windows/Linux)

## Internal Architecture

| Component   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **SuperBlock** | Tracks total and free inodes |
| **Inode**      | Represents each file (filename, size, type, etc.) |
| **FileTable**  | Tracks opened file, offsets, and access mode |
| **UFDT**       | Array of pointers to FileTable (file descriptor mapping) |

---

## File Structure

- `SuperBlock`: Global state for inode tracking.
- `Inode`: One per file; implemented as a linked list.
- `FileTable`: Created on file open; tracks read/write positions.
- `UFDT`: Simulated user file descriptor table.

## Author

This project is built to simulate real-world file system concepts using C.  
Developed and maintained by **Prem Choudhary**.

Feel free to enhance it further with:
- Directory support
- Persistent storage (save/load filesystem to disk)
- Command history or shell script support
- Increase the `MAXFILESIZE` to support larger file content
